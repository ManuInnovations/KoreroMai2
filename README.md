# Using the App
The app is a simple library of the Māori alphabet, with some related multimedia files.
The user simply clicks on a letter they want to learn.  They will see a page with a Capital, Lowercase and some images/words with the letter showing it in context.  The letters and images can all be clicked on, and the user will hear the letter or word pronounced in te reo Māori.  This can be repeated as many times as needed, to learn the correct pronounciation.
